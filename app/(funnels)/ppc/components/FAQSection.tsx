      question: "Is digital marketing suitable for small and growing businesses?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer:
        "Paid advertising can start generating leads within days. SEO, content, and organic strategies typically take 3–6 months to show consistent results, depending on competition and execution.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer customized marketing strategies?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Every strategy is built from scratch based on your business goals, audience, industry, budget, and growth stage. We do not use one-size-fits-all plans.",

    {
      question: "Which services do you cover?",
      answer:
        "We provide end-to-end digital marketing including paid ads, SEO, social media management, content, landing pages, funnel optimization, and performance tracking.",

    },
    {
      question: "Will I get regular performance reports?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You’ll receive clear and actionable reports covering traffic, leads, conversions, cost per lead, and overall ROI, along with insights and next steps.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who owns the ad accounts, data, and creatives?",
      answer:
        "You do. All ad accounts, analytics, data, and creatives remain fully owned by you. We believe in complete transparency and long-term trust.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum contract or long-term commitment?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure success?",
      answer:
        "Success is measured using business-focused metrics such as qualified leads, conversions, revenue impact, and return on investment — not vanity metrics.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Pinnacle different from other agencies?",
      answer:
        "We focus on systems, clarity, and outcomes. Instead of chasing trends or impressions, we build repeatable growth engines backed by data, execution, and ownership.",
