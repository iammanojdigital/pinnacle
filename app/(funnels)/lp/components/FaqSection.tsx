    question: "How much budget do I need for Google Ads?",
    answer: "We recommend starting with at least ₹500–₹1,500 per day depending on your industry and competition. You can increase this as you see positive ROI."
  },
  {
    question: "When will I start getting leads?",

  },
  {
    question: "Will I get guaranteed leads or sales?",
    answer: "While we can't guarantee a specific number of sales, we focus on bringing high-intent traffic to your site and improving conversion rates through expert optimisation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a website or landing page?",
    answer: "Yes, you need a functional landing page or website. If you don't have one, we can build a high-converting landing page for you at an additional cost."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you track the performance of my ads?",
    answer: "We set up comprehensive conversion tracking through Google Analytics and Google Ads, so you can see exactly where your leads and sales are coming from."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you specialise in?",
    answer: "We have experience across real estate, education, healthcare, e-commerce, and professional services, helping businesses scale their lead generation."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel the service anytime?",
    answer: "Yes, our monthly packages are flexible. We recommend at least a 3-month commitment for the best data-driven results, but you are not locked into a long-term contract."
